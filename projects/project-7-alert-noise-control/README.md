# 🔕 Project 7: Intelligent Alert Noise Reduction (AIOps)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an alert noise reduction mechanism using thresholds and cooldown windows to prevent alert flooding.

Only meaningful and repeated incidents trigger alerts, simulating real-world AIOps alert suppression logic.

---

## 🎯 Features
- CPU usage monitoring
- Threshold-based alerting
- Alert frequency tracking
- Cooldown window implementation
- Email-based alert escalation
- Automated execution using cron

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Bash Scripting
- Cron Jobs
- Mail Utility
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 AIOps Concept Demonstrated
- Event suppression
- Alert deduplication
- Smart escalation
- Noise reduction

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters
Reducing alert fatigue is a core challenge in AIOps. This project demonstrates how intelligent alerting improves system reliability and engineer efficiency.
