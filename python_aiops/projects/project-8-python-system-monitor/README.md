# 🐍 Project 8: Python-Based AIOps System Health Monitor

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Python-based system monitoring engine that collects CPU, memory, and disk metrics, correlates them, and generates intelligent severity-based alerts.

The system outputs structured JSON logs suitable for AIOps and log analytics platforms.
